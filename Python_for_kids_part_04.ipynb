        "In the original Lunar, players controlled only the amount of vertical thrust to apply, based on their current vertical velocity and remaining fuel, with each round representing one second of travel time. Rocket added a simple text-based graphical display of the distance from the ground in each round, while LEM added horizontal velocity and the ability to apply thrust at an angle.\n",

        "\n",
        "We'll need to use a few variables to keep track of a few parameters of our lander. We won't be using accurate Physics for this game, but we'll be tracking the `speed` of the lander as it races closer to the moon, the `altitude` of the lander relative to the surface of the moon, and the amount of `fuel` left on the lander.\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
